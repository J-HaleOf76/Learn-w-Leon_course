## This is from the notes app that I installed for VSCode

* This was saved in the root of the folder structure.clear.

* All I need to do to start a new note with the app is start a new note and label it md Then it will be added to the folder root.

* This might be great for what I want to do with notes and keeping track of thoughts

* Might be useful for tacking notes for myself

* I made a modification to the folder structure to fit everything into 1 weekly class.
