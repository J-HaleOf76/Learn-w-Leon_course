//---Easy
//create a function that subtracts two numbers and alerts the difference
function sub2Alert(n1,n2) {
 let sum = n1 - n2
  alert(sum)
}
sub2Alert(9, 3)
//create a function that divides three numbers and console logs the quotient
function divide3Log(num1,num2,num3) {
  console.log(num1 / num2 / num3)
}
divide3Log(12,4,3)
//create a function that multiplys three numbers and returns the product

//---Medium
//create a function that takes in three numbers. Add the first two numbers and return the remainder of dividing the sum of the first two numbers by the third number

//---Hard

//create a function that takes in 4 numbers. 
// Multiply the first two numbers. 
// If the product is greater than 100 add the sum of the last two numbers and 
// console log the value. If the product is less that 100, 
// subtract the difference of the last two numbers and console log the value. 
// If the product is 100, multiply the first three numbers together and alert the remainder of dividing the fourth number
