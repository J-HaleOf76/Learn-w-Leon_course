### These notes are coming from an extension in VSCode called Foam

```TEXT
Foam is a note-taking tool that lives within VS Code, which means you can pair it with your favorite extensions for a great editing experience.

Foam is open source, and allows you to create a local first, markdown based, personal knowledge base. You can also use it to publish your notes.

Foam is also meant to be extensible, so you can integrate with its internals to customize your knowledge base.
